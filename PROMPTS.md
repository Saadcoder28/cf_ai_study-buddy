# AI Prompts Used in Development

This document contains all AI prompts used during the development of cf_ai_study-buddy, as required by the Cloudflare assignment.

## Project Planning & Architecture

### Initial Project Design
```
Prompt: "Based on my resume showing experience in adaptive learning systems, NLP, 
and full-stack development, design an AI-powered application for Cloudflare that 
uses: 1) Llama 3.3 on Workers AI, 2) Workflows/Workers for coordination, 3) Chat/voice 
input via Pages, and 4) Durable Objects for state. The project should showcase my 
research background while being practical and deployable."

Response: Designed AI Study Buddy - an adaptive learning assistant that combines 
educational AI research with modern edge computing.
```

### Architecture Decisions
```
Prompt: "Explain the best way to implement conversation memory and adaptive difficulty 
in a Cloudflare Workers environment with Durable Objects. Should I use one Durable 
Object per session or per user?"

Response: Recommended one Durable Object per study session for better isolation, 
with session IDs as keys. This allows multiple concurrent study sessions and 
easier cleanup of old data.
```

## Backend Development

### Worker Setup
```
Prompt: "Create a Cloudflare Worker entry point that handles: 1) Session creation, 
2) Chat messages with streaming, 3) Progress tracking. Include CORS headers and 
proper error handling. Use TypeScript."

Response: Generated worker/src/index.ts with RESTful API structure
```

### Durable Objects Implementation
```
Prompt: "Write a Durable Object class called StudySession that stores: conversation 
history (array of messages), user performance metrics (topics understood, difficulty 
level), and learning preferences. Include methods for: addMessage, getHistory, 
updatePerformance, and calculateMastery."

Response: Generated StudySession.ts with persistent state management
```

### Workers AI Integration
```
Prompt: "Create a utility function to call Cloudflare Workers AI with Llama 3.3. 
Include: 1) Custom system prompt for educational tutoring, 2) Conversation history 
injection, 3) Streaming support, 4) Error handling. The system prompt should adapt 
based on student's current difficulty level."

Response: Generated ai.ts with adaptive system prompts
```

### Adaptive Learning Logic
```
Prompt: "Implement an adaptive difficulty algorithm that: 1) Tracks if student 
understands responses (based on follow-up questions), 2) Adjusts complexity level 
(beginner/intermediate/advanced), 3) Recommends next topics. Use TypeScript and 
make it modular."

Response: Generated adaptive.ts with performance tracking
```

### Workflows Implementation
```
Prompt: "Create a Cloudflare Workflow for the learning session that: 1) Initializes 
session state, 2) Processes each message through the LLM, 3) Updates performance 
metrics, 4) Triggers difficulty adjustments when needed, 5) Saves to Durable Object. 
Include proper error handling and retry logic."

Response: Generated learning.ts workflow with orchestration logic
```

## Frontend Development

### React App Structure
```
Prompt: "Create a React app with Vite and TailwindCSS for the study buddy. Include: 
1) Chat interface with message history, 2) Input field with send button, 3) Loading 
states for streaming, 4) Progress bar showing learning metrics, 5) Clean, accessible 
design. Use TypeScript and functional components with hooks."

Response: Generated App.tsx with complete UI structure
```

### Chat Component
```
Prompt: "Build a Chat component that: 1) Displays messages in a scrollable container, 
2) Shows typing indicators during AI response, 3) Auto-scrolls to new messages, 
4) Distinguishes user vs AI messages with different styling, 5) Handles streaming 
responses. Use TailwindCSS for styling."

Response: Generated Chat.tsx with real-time message rendering
```

### Voice Input Feature
```
Prompt: "Create a VoiceInput component using the Web Speech API that: 1) Has a 
microphone button, 2) Converts speech to text, 3) Sends to chat on completion, 
4) Shows recording status, 5) Handles browser compatibility. Include fallback 
for unsupported browsers."

Response: Generated VoiceInput.tsx with speech recognition
```

### API Client
```
Prompt: "Write a TypeScript API client for the frontend that: 1) Creates sessions, 
2) Sends chat messages, 3) Fetches progress data, 4) Handles streaming responses 
with fetch EventSource, 5) Includes proper error handling and types."

Response: Generated client.ts with typed API methods
```

### Progress Tracking UI
```
Prompt: "Create a ProgressBar component that displays: 1) Current difficulty level, 
2) Topics mastered (with percentages), 3) Total messages exchanged, 4) Visual 
progress bars with smooth animations. Use TailwindCSS and make it responsive."

Response: Generated ProgressBar.tsx with animated metrics
```

## Configuration & Deployment

### Wrangler Configuration
```
Prompt: "Write a wrangler.toml configuration for a Worker that uses: 1) Workers AI 
binding, 2) Durable Objects binding for StudySession, 3) Workflows, 4) Proper 
migrations. Use compatibility_date of 2024-01-01."

Response: Generated complete wrangler.toml
```

### Vite Configuration
```
Prompt: "Create a vite.config.ts for React + TypeScript that: 1) Proxies API calls 
to localhost:8787 during development, 2) Uses proper React plugin, 3) Optimizes 
build for Cloudflare Pages deployment."

Response: Generated vite.config.ts with proxy setup
```

### Package.json Scripts
```
Prompt: "Write npm scripts for: 1) Running worker dev server, 2) Running frontend 
dev server, 3) Building for production, 4) Running both concurrently in dev, 5)
